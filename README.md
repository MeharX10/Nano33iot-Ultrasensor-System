# Nano33iot-Ultrasensor-System
A compact, interrupt-driven sensor system for the Arduino Nano 33 IoT. It reads distance (HC-SR04), ambient light (BH1750) and a slide potentiometer threshold, and actuates LEDs + a buzzer. Designed as a single-file, assessor-ready project with timer and external-interrupt logic.
